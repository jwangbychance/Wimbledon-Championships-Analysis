# Wimbledon Championships Analysis Project
The purpose of the project was to construct interactive and informative Tableau graphs that display useful information of win rates for each gender, player nationalities, champions and runner-ups. The dataset used to create the interactive graphs contained 133 years of championship matches within the range of 1877 and 2019. The variety of graphs uncovers the relationships between the nationality and match times, player performances and highlights, and much more.
